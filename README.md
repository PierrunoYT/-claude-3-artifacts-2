# Coder Renderer

Coder Renderer is a web application that combines a React frontend with a Node.js backend to provide a coding and rendering environment.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Frontend (React application)
2. Backend (Node.js server)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PierrunoYT/claude-3-artifacts-2.git
   cd claude-3-artifacts-2
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm install
   cd coder-renderer
   npm install
   cd ../coder-renderer-backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

## Usage

To run the application:

1. From the root directory, start both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will start the React development server for the frontend and the Node.js server for the backend.
